Hi! :wave:  

We’re excited that you’re using PEXI and we’d love to help you make the most out of it.
To help us help you, please read through the following guidelines.
Please understand that people involved with this project often do so for fun, next to their day job; you are not entitled to free customer service.

## Asking Quality Questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.
It’s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when you’re close to a problem.
Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional questions
to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time upfront can help save everyone time in the long run.
* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  * Is there a concept you’re not understanding?
* Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method](https://rubberduckdebugging.com).
* Avoid falling for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378).
* Search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked.  
  You can check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/drachenpapa/pexi/issues/) or [Discussions](https://github.com/drachenpapa/pexi/discussions) for existing solutions.
* If possible, provide sample code or a repository that demonstrates the problem.
* The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you.
